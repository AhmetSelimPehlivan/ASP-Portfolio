    paragraph: 'Machine learning is a type of AI that teaches computer systems how to learn and improve from experience, without being directly programmed. It trains them to recognize patterns, and make predictions based on data. I am interested in using machine learning to develop recommendation systems.'

    title: 'Deep Learning',
    paragraph: 'Deep learning is a form of machine learning that trains artificial neural networks to make predictions or decisions based on data. I am interested in using deep learning for image processing. Currently, I am working on classifying yoga poses, and face yoga poses, and detecting skin anomalies on faces. To do this, I use advanced technology, such as TensorFlow 2.0'

    title: 'Web and Native Apps',
    paragraph: 'Web apps are accessed through a web browser and run on a remote server. Native apps are developed for specific operating systems like iOS or Android and are installed directly onto a mobile device or computer. They offer better performance. I have experience with Reactjs, Vanilla CSS, Html, and Sass for the frontend side and Nodejs, Nextjs, Flask, Firebase, MongoDB, and MySql for the backend and server side.'

    title: 'VR/AR Game',
    paragraph: 'VR (Virtual Reality) games create a fully immersive, three-dimensional environment that allows players to interact with a virtual world, while AR (Augmented Reality) games layer digital elements onto the real world through the use of a camera or smart glasses. I am developing a mobile AR goalkeeper game. Also, I developed a Metaschool VR game project.'
